# Huh?
This is some code. When running on an ATMega microcontroller, it bitbangs a signal to drive some WS2811 pixels to [blink in a manner not unlike this](http://i.imgur.com/anM28gf.gif).

## Wait, this is what now?
Yep. It blinks and confuses people. Pretty cool, right?

## Uh, sure.
Neat.

# "Blinkenlichten"?
